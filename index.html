                        Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017, and had previously questioned
                        the platform's commitment
                        to freedom of speech.In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares,
                        reaching a 9.2% stake by
                        April,making him the largest shareholder. When this was publicly disclosed,
                        Twitter shares experienced the
                        largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013 IPO.On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that
                        would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring
                        more than 14.9% of the company.However, on April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to
                        buy Twitter, launching
                        a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share.

                        Musk speaks of his early business experience during a 2014 commencement speech at USC on YouTube

                        In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Zip2. Errol Musk provided them
                        with
                        $28,000 in
                        funding.The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow
                        pages,
                        and
                        marketed it to
                        newspapers.

                        Later in 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment
                        company.X.com was one of the
                        first federally insured online banks, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of
                        operation. Even
                        though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with
                        Intuit CEO Bill Harris by
                        the end of the year.

                        In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans
                        to place a
                        growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[74] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow with
                        Jim Cantrell and Adeo
                        Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the
                        greenhouse payloads into space.

                        In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to
                        provide satellite
                        Internet access,[93] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second
                        set of test satellites,
                        and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the
                        first 60 operational
                        satellites were launched.

                        United States.
